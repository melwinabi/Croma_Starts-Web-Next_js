# STEPS TAKEN TO PUSH "CROMA STARTS WEB" TO GITHUB

This file records how we fixed the 403 errors and successfully uploaded your project.

---

### STEP 1: ENTER THE PROJECT FOLDER
Command: cd ~/Documents/croma-starts-web

### STEP 2: FIX THE REMOTE LINK (THE "BRIDGE")
We had to tell the computer exactly where to send the files. We used your TOKEN inside the link so you don't have to type a password every time.
Command:
git remote set-url origin https://[YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN]@github.com/melwinabi/Croma_Starts-Web-Next_js.git

### STEP 3: PREPARE THE FILES
Command: git add .

### STEP 4: SAVE THE CHANGES (COMMIT)
Command: git commit -m "Initial professional setup"

### STEP 5: THE GITHUB WEBSITE FIX (THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP!)
When we got the "403 Permission Denied" error, we did this on the GitHub website:
1. Went to 'Personal Access Tokens' in Settings.
2. Selected your token.
3. Changed 'Public repositories' to 'ALL repositories'.
4. Changed 'Permissions' -> 'Repository permissions' -> 'Contents' to 'READ AND WRITE'.
5. Clicked the green 'UPDATE' button.

### STEP 6: UPLOAD EVERYTHING
Command: git push -u origin main

1. git add .
2. git commit -m "Updated some files"
3. git push
